## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a city name  
2. JavaScript sends a fetch request to the OpenWeather API  
3. The API returns weather data in JSON format  
4. The UI updates dynamically with:
   - City name
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
   - Weather icon  
5. Invalid input shows an error message

## 🚧 Error Handling

- Empty input is ignored  
- Invalid city names display an error message  
- API failures are handled using `response.ok`  

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Loading animation  
- Auto-detect user location  
- 5-day weather forecast
